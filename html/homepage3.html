    <title>Yelp Business Dataset Graph and Dijkstra's Shortest Path</title>

      <h1>Yelp Dataset Recommendation Engine</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 14px">
        Select an item from the dropdown to select a business.  Upon selection a Dijkstra's algorithm will be executed to find the shortest path to the cluster medoid to which that business is part of.  The parameters of the graph
        are as follows - the nodes are the businesses in the cluster, the edges are the 4 closest geographic neighbours and the weighting is determined by a Jacard Set Similarity score.  Given these parameters it is possible
        to select a business that won't necessarily have a path to the cluster medoid.  If a path is found, the businesses along the path, along with their edge weighting will be displayed, otherwise a message will be displayed
        indicating that a could not be found.

        Dijkstra's Shortest Path Results

      <h2>Calculation Process</h2>
      <h3>Application</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1) Loads Yelp Dataset of Businesses, iterates through line by line getting Restaurant businesses with a minimum of 100
          reviews, meanwhile it saves each business as a file and adds the filename to a Extensible Hash Table (EHT) which in this case
          is used as a file index.  The EHT is then serialized and saved to disk.</li>
        </li>
        <li>2) The K-Medoids Statistical component is executed, the EHT is loaded and deserialized.  Then the EHT is iterated through the
          business files are loaded and converted to a vector of the business's location and star rating.  The K-Medoids algorithm is started
          iterating through the dataset to create k-number of clusters (in this case just 10)
        </li>
        <li>
          3) As a result of the algorithm, a 2D array like data structure is returned with some bookkeeping information each
          dimension.  The first dimension is the cluster number and also contains the file name for the medoid of cluster
          and the second dimension is the business file name along with metric information such as latitude, longitude, and
          and stars.  This data structured is then serialized and saved to disk.
        </li>
        <li>
          4) Afterwards using the K-medoids data structure the elements are iterated through and added to a graph data structure as a node.  Then
          the nodes are iterated through again, a sort is performed against a temporary copy of the node's respective cluster, and edges
          are set to the 4 closet neighbours as a result of the sort.  (Look for elements 1-4 since 0 would be the node itself).
          Edge weighting calculation is performed using the Jacard Set Similarity Coefficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          5) Lastly a Union Find is performed on the graph data structure to determine the number of disjoint sets after the edges have been set.
          The graph is then deserialized and saved to disk.
        </li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Loader</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1) Loads the serialized K-Medoids data structure from disk and deserializes it.</li>
        <li>2) Server is started on port 7500 to serve random business list and respond with related clusters</li>
        <li>3) Upon selection of a business, business id is sent to back end, filename is retrieved from EHT, and file is loaded
          as business object.
        </li>
        <li>4) Using the lat, long and stars of the business a Calculation is performed on each saved cluster medoid to determine which cluster the
          selected business belongs to.  The cluster is then loaded and the selected business is compared to each business in the cluster
          to determine which business is the closest to the selected business.  The closest business is then returned to the front end, along with selected
          and medoid business for the given cluster. 
        </li>

      </ul>
