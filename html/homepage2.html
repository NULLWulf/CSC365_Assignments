        Select an item from the dropdown to get a randomly related business. The
        relation is determined by a correlation of terms found within the
        businesses' reviews. (Both the selected, and 'related' businesses)

      <h2>Calculation Process</h2>
      <ul style="margin: 10px; padding: 5px">
        <li>
          <b>1) Pull in Business JSON DATA:</b> First Bussiness JSON data is
          loaded into memory as a glob.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2) Add Bussinesses to Map: </b>Glob is then iterated through and
          Bussinesses that are <i>Restraunts</i> and have a Review Count of at
          least 100 are added to the map. (This value can be tweaked globally on
          the backend
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>3) Iterate Through Review JSON data: </b>Then the Review JSON file
          is iterated through line by line. Because this JSON file is so large
          it becomes neccesary to buffer it vs pull the entire text contents
          into memory as I did with the Business JSON. A globally adjustable
          limit is set to 25,000 reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>4) Tokenize/Generate Raw Count: </b>For each review the Business
          map is iterated through to attempt to find a match. When the Business
          ID of a Review and Business match, then Review's text is then cleaned
          of stop words, split into an array by spaces, and a raw term frequency
          count is appended to the respective business raw term frequency count
          map. This is a map that stores the term frequency count for a term
          across <i>all</i> of it's respective reviews. Since I am only getting
          term frequency counts for businesses, the review data itself is
          volatile and does not get directly associated with the Business
          object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>5) Remove Null Reviews/Calculate Term frequency: </b> The business
          is then iterated through again. If a business has reviews, then the
          raw term frequency count is divided by the review count to get the
          term frequency. This map is then appended to the business object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>6) Calculate Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency: </b> The
          business map is then iterated through again, and the term frequency
          inverse document frequency is calculated for each term. This is done
          by dividing the total number of businesses by the number of businesses
          that contain the term. The log of this value is then taken to get the
          term frequency inverse document frequency. Then the term frequency and
          inverse document frequency are multiplied to get a map of a
          Businesses' terms' TF-IDF. This is then appended to the business
          object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>7) Sort TF-IDF for Bussinesses: </b>Businesses are then iterated
          through and the TF-IDF map is sorted by value. The resulting TF-IDF
          map is sorted greatest to least.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>8) Generate TermKeyMap: </b>Businesses are then iterated a final
          time. This time each business is iterated through and the most
          valueable terms are added to a related terms map. This map is a map of
          arrays where the key is a term and the value is an array of business
          IDs that contain that term. This map is used to determine which
          businesses are related to each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result is a Map where the Key is a term, and the values at each map
        element is an array of business IDs. The list of businesses in the drop
        down menu is randomly generated based on the available Businesses in the
        Business map. When selecing a business a query is performed to find the
        2 related businesses that share a term with the selected business.
