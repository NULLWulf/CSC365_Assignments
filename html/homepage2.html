        Select an item from the dropdown to get a randomly related business. Upon selection details of the selected business will appears
        along with its related business within a cluster and the cluster's medoid.  Businesses are clustered based on their location and
        star rating.  The related business is the business within the cluster that is closest to the selected business.  The medoid is the
        business within the cluster that is closest to all other businesses in the cluster.  This statistical method is known as k-medoids.

      <h2>Calculation Process</h2>
      <h3>Application</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1) Loads Yelp Dataset of Businesses, iterates through line by line getting Restaurant businesses with a minimum of 100
          reviews, meanwhile it saves each business as a file and adds the filename to a Extensible Hash Table (EHT) which in this case 
          is used as a file index.  The EHT is then serialized and saved to disk.</li>
        </li>
        <li>2) The K-Medoids Statistical component is executed, the EHT is loaded and deserialized.  Then the EHT is iterated through the
          business files are loaded and converted to a vector of the business's location and star rating.  The K-Medoids algorithm is started
          iterating through the dataset to create k-number of clusters (in this case just 10).  The K-medoids uses the
          Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere.  The Haversine formula is used to calculate the d
            distance between each business and the medoid of each cluster.  The business is then assigned to the cluster with the closest medoid.
        </li>
        <li>
          3) As a result of the algorithm, a 2D Array Data structure of clusters is created.  Each cluster contains a list of businesses that
            belong to the cluster and a medoid business that is the closest to all other businesses in the cluster.  At this time
          the cluters and businesses are iterated through and a Haver
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Loader</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1) Loads the serialized K-Medoids data structure from disk and deserializes it.</li>
        <li>2) Server is started on port 7500 to serve random business list and respond with related clusters</li>
        <li>3) Upon selection of a business, business id is sent to back end, filename is retrieved from EHT, and file is loaded
          as business object.
        </li>
        <li>4) Using the lat, long and stars of the business a Calculation is performed on each saved cluster medoid to determine which cluster the
          selected business belongs to.  The cluster is then loaded and the selected business is compared to each business in the cluster
          to determine which business is the closest to the selected business.  The closest business is then returned to the front end, along with selected
          and medoid business for the given cluster.
